Former President Trump in a Sunday interview suggested using the National Guard or the military on Election Day to combat what he described as potential chaos from “the enemy from within” — a group Trump said includes “radical left lunatics.”

In the interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump dismissed President Biden’s concerns that Election Day wouldn’t be peaceful and said, when asked, that he thinks “the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroyed our country.”

“I think the bigger problem are the people from within,” Trump said. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.”

“And I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen,” he added.

The interview comes just weeks before the election, as both Trump’s and Vice President Harris’s campaigns rev up to gain as much ground as they can in battleground states that could decide the outcome of the election.

Harris’s campaign responded to Trump’s Sunday interview by saying the comments should “alarm every American who cares about their freedom and security.”

“Donald Trump is suggesting that his fellow Americans are worse ‘enemies’ than foreign adversaries, and he is saying he would use the military against them,” Harris campaign senior adviser and senior spokesperson Ian Sams said in a statement.

“Taken with his vow to be a dictator on ‘day one,’ calls for the ‘termination’ of the Constitution, and plans to surround himself with sycophants who will give him unchecked, unprecedented power if he returns to office, this should alarm every American who cares about their freedom and security,” Sams continued. “What Donald Trump is promising is dangerous, and returning him to office is simply a risk Americans cannot afford.”
